            "While not the most common technique to create life, the mocap method is one of the most potent and effective techniques you can use to enhance your body performance. The mocap technique is basically about using a laser marker to capture the exact movements you need to make while performing certain exercises. In the beginning, mocap should be done only when it is absolutely necessary and to get used to it, you should do several sessions before practicing in front of a mirror. It is recommended to start off by using mocap during warm-ups. However, it is important to learn how to use mocap and how to use it correctly.\n",

            "\n",
            "Mocap stands for \"marking with light.\" In other words, mocap is a technique that helps you to record specific movement movements that you are making during specific exercises. Mocap is performed by using a light laser pointer to illuminate the area in front of your chest. The user presses the button that fires the laser pointer and measures the return on the measurement of the laser beam. This return is measured with a surface probe (which is specifically designed to help measure the return on the light beam), the actual size of the marker, and the size of the marker to the next nearest micron. These measurements are used to calculate the exact movement that is being recorded.\n",
            "\n",
            "Mocap can be performed both static and dynamic. Static mocap is when you rest with your arms in the same position and the laser pointer is pointing at the chest. Static mocap can be used while you are lying on your back or lying on your stomach. Dynamic mocap is performed by using the laser pointer while you are performing the exercise. This is usually done while performing a very fast repetition, such as a military press or a push-up. Dynamic mocap can also be used during any other exercise where you need to be static such as squats, leg presses, or push-ups.\n",
